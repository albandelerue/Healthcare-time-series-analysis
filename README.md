# Healthcare-time-series-analysis
## Time series challenge I performed for a telemedicine company

The main goal of this challenge was to perform an exploratory data analysis for a telemedicine company and perform a time serie analysis in order to predict the amount of nurses 
their virtual clinic would need in order to answer the growing demand.

For this challenge, I used the typical data analysis libraries in Python such as:
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib

For the time series, I used a SARIMAX model that takes into account the trend and seasonality of the serie.
